The Eels spend most of their lives in freshwater at a depth range of 10-32 ft (3-10 m), but migrate to the Indian Ocean to breed. The Eels feed primarily off of crustaceans, mollusks, finfish and worms.',

These Catfish typically live in freshwater lakes, rivers, swamps, oxidation ponds or even urban sewage systems. The ASC is one of the very largest Catfish in African waters, with a mouth so large it typically swallows its prey whole.

Juveniles of the species prey on invertebrates, whereas adults subsist on detritus and mud. They are valued as an important, nutritious food source and is recommended for use in wastewater aquaculture in combination with other aquatic organisms. Moggel are occasionally caught by anglers using bait or flies whilst targeting other species and is known for its strong fighting ability. They are often regarded as an 'easter egg' fish when caught, as they are nearly impossible to target specifically and catches are usually by chance.",

It is a fish of mountain streams and lakes, favoring clear cold water and large deep pools of at least 3 ft (91 cm). Mountain whitefish are bottom feeders, stirring up the substrate with pectoral and tail fins to expose insect larvae and other invertebrates, including snails, crayfish, and amphipods. Their main feeding time is in the evening, but they will also take drifting prey during the day. The mountain whitefish frequently feeds in the lower strata of streams, but populations may rise to the surface to prey on hatching insects, including mayflies.',

Coloration varies widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males. Rainbow Trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. Rainbow Trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects. They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects that fall into the water. Rainbow Trout and Steelhead are highly regarded game fish. Rainbow Trout are a popular target for fly fishers, and several angling methods are used. Many anglers consider the Rainbow Trout the hardest-fighting trout species, as this fish is known for leaping when hooked and putting up a powerful struggle. It is considered one of the top five sport fish in North America and the most important game fish west of the Rocky Mountains.',
